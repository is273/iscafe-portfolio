# How to play Tic-Tac-Toe
## <mark>WARNING: ELECTRIC SHOCK</mark>
Tic-tac-toe is a game where two players, X and O, must place three of their marks in a row to win.

## Before you begin
To play tic-tac-toe, you will need the following:
- Paper
- Pen or Pencil

## Steps
1. On a piece of paper, draw two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines to create nine equal spaces.
2. Choose who uses the X or O marks and who goes first.
3. Take turns writing your marks in an empty space with a pen or pencil.
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

The game ends in a tie if all the spaces are filled and there is no winner. You can play again until a player wins.
